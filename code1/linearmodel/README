To start the first implementation where the user ranking are absent, 
we try to follow the simple by using linear model for forming the compatibility score

d(Tf_i,Sf_i) is the compatibility element between two features(mainly numeric) and different kind of metics can be used for evaluations

for example Pearson correlation or cosine similarity

s(T_n,S_m) = /sigma _i d_i, which is the compatibilty score between peope from tutors and tutees set for simiplicty

Later s(T_n,S_m) can be a weighted approach of d(Tf_i,Sf_i) or a function of d(Tf_i,Sf_i)


for finally ranking or rating element a linear model is constructed  with 

r_(T_n,S_m) = /beta_1 s(T_n,S_m) + screen factors (content-based)
